## Getting Started

While *in theory* it's possible to connect the Mahtanar board to your heat pump equipment and *then* provision it, this can make troubleshooting more difficult so it's recommended that at least for your first device you provision it while it's connected/powered over USB and connect it to your heat pump after it's all set up.

#### Prerequisites:

- Mahtanar board (WiFi or Ethernet model)
- CN105 connector cable
- ESPHome installed and running on your network
- Home Assistant configured with ESPHome integration

#### Setup

1. Connect the Mahtanar to a USB power source (ideally your computer for additional serial troubleshooting if needed).
2. If you have the WiFi version of the board, use your computer or mobile device to connect to the `mITP Setup` WiFi SSID with `mahtanar` as the password.  You should be prompted to connect the device to your WiFi network; do so.  If your device doesn't prompt you, open a browser to http://192.168.4.1 to connect to the ESPHome Wifi setup page.
If you have the ethernet version of the board, just connect it to your network.
3. After a moment, the device should show up on your ESPHome dashboard as `mitp-heat-pump-MACSUFFIX` with a "Take Control" option.  Press "Take Control", provide a friendly name, and copy the encryption key for later.  When prompted, press "Install".
4. Home Assistant should have discovered the device and will show it with the friendly name you provided.  Adding this device to Home Assistant will require the encryption key you copied in step 3.
5. Now that the device is provisioned, you can connect it to your heat pump using the CN105 connector cable and the port labeled `Heatpump` on the Mahtanar device.  Because power is provided by the equipment, a USB connection is no longer required unless troubleshooting.  This process can vary a bit depending on equipment, and more detailed information is provided below.
6. More information on configuring the ESPHome `mitsubishi_itp` component is [available here](https://muart-group.github.io/).  The ESPHome configuration should be available for modification on your ESPHome dashboard.

#### Troubleshooting

Frequent troubleshooting tips will be added here, but a common step will likely be to use the configuration files listed below to reset the device back to its factory defaults (or as a starting point for a manual configuration) from the ESPHome dashboard:

1. Select the branch in this repository that matches the revision number printed on your PCB.
2. Copy the contents of either the `wifi` or `ethernet` yaml files into the config on your ESPHome dashboard, and press "Install".

## Connecting to Equipment

More details to be added here, though some detailed tutorials can be found online.  The gist of the process is that **WITH THE POWER DISCONNECTED FROM YOUR EQUIPMENT** (breaker off, or lockout switch engaged, depending), you will take the cover off of the wall unit, or panel off the air handler and locate the CN105 connector on the controller board.  The connector is usually red.  There should be some sort of knockout on the cover/panel near the controller board to route the cable outside of the unit.  The cover/panel can then be reinstalled and **THEN** the power turned back on.  You can then connect the other end of the cable to the Mahtanar.

#### MHK2

The `mitsubishi_itp` component also supports MHK2 thermostats which can be connected to the other port (labeled `Thermostat`) on the Mahtanar.  Once again, configuration details are available from [this project](https://muart-group.github.io/).

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What if I don't have an MHK2?</summary>
  The board will still work fine without an MHK2; just connect only the `HP1` port to your equipment and leave the `TS1` port empty.

  If you don't plan on using a thermostat, the thermostat features can be disabled in the configuration streamline your experience.

  Comment or remove `uart_thermostat` to disable the feature:
  ``` yaml
  climate:
    - platform: mitsubishi_itp
      name: "Climate"
      uart_heatpump: hp_uart
      # uart_thermostat: tstat_uart # This and the uart component below can be removed if no thermostat connected
  ```

  Additionally, you may want to remove the `uart` component to free up pins or allow for USB logging:
  ``` yaml
  uart:
    - id: hp_uart
      baud_rate: 2400 # For some equipment this may need to be 9600
      parity: EVEN
      rx_pin:
        number: GPIO7
      tx_pin:
        number: GPIO6
    # - id: tstat_uart
    #   baud_rate: 2400 # For some equipment this may need to be 9600
    #   parity: EVEN
    #   rx_pin:
    #     number: GPIO20
    #   tx_pin:
    #     number: GPIO21
  ```

  Logging can then be reenabled if desired:
  ```yaml
  logger:
    # baud_rate: 0
    baud_rate: 115200
  ```

  <summary>How do I re-flash the board?</summary>
  In this repository, choose the branch that matched the revision number printed on your PCB (e.g. `v1.3`). Copy either the Ethernet or WiFi configuration from this repository into your ESPHome dashboard and install. If you have previously configured the WiFi, in most circumstances you will not need to reconfigure it.

## Hardware Revisions

### v1.1
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ce37ea4-a2a8-421e-a000-fe889be8c505" height="180"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f2440f-674b-4b0e-aa93-91b00f111d58" height="180"/>

- First "mass"-produced board.
- Base PCB manufactured, but all components soldered by hand.

### v1.2
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df8850b4-97a7-4426-9edd-21ad0dd7dc35" height="180"/>

- Included level-shifter and connectors in PCB design and had them assembled by manufacturer (other components still hand-soldered).
- Removed LED footprint.

### v1.3
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81a0a335-06e7-4f35-9afa-6b216d1c0c86" height="180"/>

- Switched from ESP32-C3 devboard to custom circuit using ESP32-C3-WROOM-02!
- Switched from white to blue because of fine tolerances for solder mask near USB-C port.
- Issue: Capacitor for debouncing `BOOT` button prevented normal boot on first power up. Pressing `RESET` would work; solution was to remove capacitor (as shown in photo).
- Issue: Learned that WROOM module includes 499Ω resistor in series with UART TX pin preventing this pin from reaching 0v (only got to 0.6v). This was fine for test board but caused issues on actual Mitsubishi equipment. Solution was to remove the pullup resistors on that line (as shown in photo) to achieve 0.25v which was acceptable for Mitsubishi equipment.

### v1.4
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90636464-b2cf-43bf-bb59-67b60907f519" height="180"/>

- Switched to hex buffer instead of bi-direcitonal levelshifter to work around issue with 499Ω resistor.
- Added power and status LEDs.
- Issue: Forgot to update version number on PCB silkscreen.
- Issue: Learned that while wall-units have 5v pullup resistors on their CN105 ports, that some (most?) air handlers do not. This board design only included pullups for the TX lines, so it has issues receiving messages from air handlers. Solution is to manually install a 5v pullup resistor on the Heatpump TX line.

### v1.4b
- Added pullups to the UART RX lines for the heat pump and thermostat.
- Fixed silkscreen to actually say `v1.4b`
